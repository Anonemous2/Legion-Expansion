- l_air_defense_adv
	- increased slection circle: adv aa selction hex is covered by the model (not visable).

- l_artillery_short
	- made hitbox sqaure: the base of the turret is sqaure, and the turret itself can fire 360*, so there is no need for a rectagular hitbox.

- l_bot_aa_adv
	- greatly increased hitbox: the old hitbox shape and size was similar to that of a dox.
	- greatly increased slection circle: selction hex was the same size of a dox select circle.

- l_bot_artillery_adv
	- increased slection circle: selction hex was under the monstro.'s feet.

- l_fabrication_vehicle_adv
	- increased hitbox: the old hitbox shape and size was smaller than that of the t1 legion armor fabber, and didn't fit this unit's shape and size.

- l_flame_turret
	- changed hitbox: the old hitbox shape and size was similar to the other legion turrets; rectagular and streched along the y axis, which doesn't fit the shape of the arsonist (part of the model is sticking out of the hitbox, possible to clip multiple into each other).

- l_hover_tank_adv
	- increased hitbox: another case where the t2 hitbox was smaller than it's t1 equivelent.
	- slightly increased slection circle

- l_radar_adv
	- slightly increased slection circle: it was just barely bigger than the model, could look better

- l_rocket_barrage
	- slightly increased slection circle: it was just barely bigger than the model, could look better

- l_shield_gen
	- reduced hitbox: hitbox for the shield gen was quite a bit larger than the model and select circle.

- l_sniper_bot
	- increased height of hitbox: lancer's head was sticking out of the hitbox, which is almost the same as the dox's hitbox while being a larger unit.

- l_t1_turret_basic
	- squred hitbox, increased hitbox height: better reflects shape of the turret

- l_teleporter
	- enlarged hitbox
	- enlarged selection: Legion teleporters are real chonkers. Now they don't form a mega structure when you build a line of them (stopped clipping with other structures).

- l_titan_bot
	- widen hitbox: The Thor is big. it's hitbox was a pilar. now the hitbox makes abit more sense, and should stop the thor from stepping on any unlucky units escorting it.

- l_titan_structure
	- slightly reduced hitbox: Getting a Holocene off can be a challenge with its thick hitbox, but it turns out it doesn't even need to be quite that large (You can hit 4 rag hitbox inside the old hol hitbox). Slightly reducing the hitbox should improve usage and will still look and feel fine.
	- increased selection ciricle: Select hex was getting covered by the unit. 

### Air
- l_air_bomb
	- reduced select circle: Nova selection circle is quite big for its size, and especially compared to other air units.

		- increased select circle: you can barely see it.
